## v0.6.0
### CONTRIBUTORS
- wilsonrljr
- oliveira-mark

### CHANGES
This release introduces significant improvements focused on improving code organization, readability, and compliance with PEP8 standards. It also includes a new foundational class for Error Reduction Ratio (ERR) based algorithms, expanded testing, and the discontinuation of Python 3.7 support.

#### New Features
  - Introduced the `OFRBase` class, encapsulating common methods essential for ERR-based algorithms.
  - Refactored the `FROLS` class to inherit from `OFRBase`, focusing it solely on the ERR algorithm.
  - Implemented the Ultra Orthogonal Forward Regression (UOFR) algorithm, also inheriting from `OFRBase`.

#### API Changes
  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Fixed a typo in Bernstein Basis Function. Previously it was defined as Bersntein.
  - **Refactoring and Modularization:**
    - Extracted the `InformationMatrix` class from `narmax_base` into a new module: `utils.information_matrix`.
    - Moved specific methods to newly created modules: `utils.lags` and `utils.simulation`, promoting better separation of concerns.
    - Add deprecation message for RidgeRegression `solver` argument.

#### Code Quality Improvements
  - Renamed variables and methods for better readability and PEP8 compliance, including changing uppercase variable names to lowercase.
  - Updated imports to use new utility modules, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
  - Removed unused imports and redundant parentheses, streamlining the codebase.
  - Change python version in deploy action.

#### Testing Enhancements
  - Added comprehensive tests for basis functions: Bernstein, Bilinear, Hermite (normalized), Laguerre, and Legendre.
  - Introduced tests for utility methods, including `narmax_tools`, `save_load`, and the new simulation utilities.
  - Increased test coverage to **92%**, ensuring robustness and reliability.

#### Validation and Error Handling
  - Implemented a validation check for `train_percentage`, raising an error for values exceeding 100%.
  - Adapted methods and tests following the removal of the `InformationMatrix` class to ensure consistency across the codebase.

#### Documentation Updates
  - Launched a redesigned frontend page featuring a modern UI and improved responsiveness.
  - Restructured multiple sections for better organization and clarity.
  - Overhauled key guides, including `quick_start`, `developer_guide`, and `user_guide`.
  - Added new examples, including the Lorenz System and Chaotic Map.
  - Enhanced grammar and readability across documentation.
  - Updated dependencies related to `mkdocs` for better performance and compatibility.
  - Improved Google Analytics integration.
  - Fixed broken links for the Nubank and Estatidados blogs, and refined link formatting in the book.
  - Updated class docstrings to align with the latest changes.
  - Standardized docstrings and method signatures to use lowercase variable names, following PEP8 guidelines.
  - Revised contribution examples to reflect the latest `sysidentpy` version.
  - Integrated book examples into traditional documentation, with direct links to the book section.
  - Adjusted structure, titles, and links across various docs and examples for better navigation.
  - Removed dataset files; datasets are now hosted in a dedicated repository, `sysidentpy-data`.
  - Acknowledged JetBrains support and collaboration in the README and sponsor page.
  - Fix edit uri when clicking to edit doc page in doc website.
  - Now every example loads the data from `sysidentpy-data` repository.

#### Python Version Support Update
  - **Support for Python 3.7 has been discontinued.** This aligns with the official end of support for Python 3.7 and resolves compatibility issues with newer dependencies.
  - Certain parameter estimation algorithms, such as Bounded Variable Least Squares, require newer versions of SciPy that no longer support Python 3.7.
  - Users can still run SysIdentPy on Python 3.7, but some features, including some parameter estimation functionalities, will be unavailable.

#### IMPACT
- These changes improve the modularity, readability, and maintainability of the codebase. The introduction of the `OFRBase` class simplifies the implementation of ERR-based algorithms, facilitating future extensions. Comprehensive testing ensures the reliability of both new and existing functionalities.

#### TESTING
- All new and existing tests were executed, achieving **92% test coverage**.

## v0.4.0

### CONTRIBUTORS

- wilsonrljr

### CHANGES

This update introduces several major features and changes, including some breaking changes. There is a guide to help you update your code to the new version. Depending on your model definition, you might not need to change anything. I decided to go directly to version v0.4.0 instead of providing incremental updates (0.3.5, 0.3.6, etc.) because the breaking changes are easy to fix and the new features are highly beneficial. This release provides crucial groundwork for the future development of SysIdentPy, making easier to add new features and improve the code, setting the stage for a robust and feature-complete 1.0.0 release in the feature.

#### New Features
- **MAJOR**: NonNegative Least Squares algorithm for parameter estimation.
- **MAJOR**: Bounded Variables Least Squares algorithm for parameter estimation.
- **MAJOR**: Least Squares Minimal Residual algorithm for parameter estimation.
- **MAJOR**: Error Reduction Ratio algorithm enhancement for FROLS model structure selection. Users can now set an `err_tol` value to stop the algorithm when the sum of the ERR values reaches this threshold, offering a faster alternative to Information Criteria algorithms. A new example is available in the documentation.
- **MAJOR**: New Bernstein basis function available, allowing users to choose between Polynomial, Fourier, and Bernstein.
- **MAJOR**: v0.1 of the companion book "Nonlinear System Identification: Theory and Practice With SysIdentPy." This open-source book serves as robust documentation for the SysIdentPy package and a friendly introduction to Nonlinear System Identification and Timeseries Forecasting. There are case studies in the book that were not included in the documentation at the time of the update release. The book will always feature more in-depth studies and will be updated regularly with additional case studies.

#### Documentation
- All examples updated to reflect changes in v0.4.0.
- Added guide on defining a custom parameter estimation method and integrating it with SysIdentPy.
- Documentation moved to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Defined a GitHub Action to automatically build the docs when changes are pushed to the main branch.
- Removal of unused code in general

#### Datasets
- Datasets are now available in a separate repository.

#### API Changes
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Parameter estimation method must now be imported and passed to the model definition, replacing the previous string method. For example, use `from sysidentpy.parameter_estimation import LeastSquares` instead of `"least_squares"`. This change enhances code flexibility, organization, readability, and facilitates easier integration of custom methods. A specific doc page is available to guide migration from v0.3.4 to v0.4.0.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The `fit` method in MetaMSS now requires only `X` and `y` values, omitting the need to pass `fit(X=, y=, X_test=, y_test=)`.
- Added support for Python 3.12.
- Introduced `test_size` hyperparameter to set the proportion of training data used in the fitting process.
- Extensive code refactoring, including type hint improvements, docstring enhancements, removal of unused code, and other behind-the-scenes changes to support new features.

#### API Changes
- MAJOR: Estimators support in AOLS
    - Now you can use any SysIdentPy estimator in AOLS model structure selection.

- Refactored base class for model structure selection. A refactored base class for model structure selection has been introduced in SysIdentPy. This update aims to enhance the system identification process by preparing the package for new features that are currently in development, like multiobjective parameter estimation, new basis functions and more.

  Several methods within the base class have undergone significant restructuring to improve their functionality and optimize their performance. This reorganization will facilitate the incorporation of advanced model selection techniques in the future, which will enable users to obtain dynamic models with robust dynamic and static performance.
  - Avoid unnecessary inheritance in every MSS method and improve the readability with better structured classes.
  - Rewritten methods to avoid code duplication.
  - Improve overall code readability by rewriting if/elif/else clauses.

## v0.1.7

### CONTRIBUTORS

- wilsonrljr

### CHANGES

- The update **v0.1.7**  has been released with major changes and additional features. There are several API modifications, and you will need to change your code to have the new (and upcoming) features. All modifications are meant to make future expansion easier.
- On the user's side, the changes are not that disruptive, but in the background there are many changes that allowed the inclusion of new features and bug fixes that would be complex to solve without the changes. Check the `documentation page <http://sysidentpy.org/notebooks.html>`__
- Many classes were basically rebuild it from scratch, so I suggest to look at the new examples of how to use the new version.
- I will present the main updates below in order to highlight features and usability and then all API changes will be reported.

#### API Changes
- MAJOR: NARX models with Fourier basis function `Issue63 <https://github.com/wilsonrljr/sysidentpy/issues/63>`__, `Issue64 <https://github.com/wilsonrljr/sysidentpy/issues/64>`__
    - The user can choose which basis they want by importing it from sysidentpy.basis_function. Check the notebooks with examples of how to use it.
    - Polynomial and Fourier are supported for now. New basis functions will be added in next releases.
- MAJOR: NAR models `Issue58 <https://github.com/wilsonrljr/sysidentpy/issues/58>`__
    - It was already possible to build Polynomial NAR models, but with some hacks. Now the user just need to pass model_type="NAR" to build NAR models.
    - The user doesn't need to pass a vector of zeros as input anymore.
    - Works for any model structure selection algorithm (FROLS, AOLS, MetaMSS)
- Major: NFIR models `Issue59 <https://github.com/wilsonrljr/sysidentpy/issues/59>`__
    - NFIR models are models where the output depends only on past inputs. It was already possible to build Polynomial NFIR models, but with a lot of code on the user's side (much more than NAR, btw). Now the user just need to pass model_type="NFIR" to build NFIR models.
    - Works for any model structure selection algorithm (FROLS, AOLS, MetaMSS)
- Major: Select the order for the residues lags to use in Extended Least Squares - elag
    - The user can select the maximum lag of the residues to be used in the Extended Least Squares algorithm. In previous versions sysidentpy used a predefined subset of residual lags.
    - The degree of the lags follows the degree of the basis function
- Major: Residual analysis methods `Issue60 <https://github.com/wilsonrljr/sysidentpy/issues/60>`__

### CHANGES

#### API Changes
- MAJOR: Meta-Model Structure Selection Algorithm (Meta-MSS).
    - A new method for build NARMAX models based on metaheuristics. The algorithm uses a Binary hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm with a new cost function to build parsimonious models.
    - New class for the BPSOGSA algorithm. New algorithms can be adapted in the Meta-MSS framework.
	- Future updates will add NARX models for classification and multiobjective model structure selection.
- MAJOR: Accelerated Orthogonal Least-Squares algorithm.
    - Added the new class AOLS to build NARX models using the Accelerated Orthogonal Least-Squares algorithm.
    - At the best of my knowledge, this is the first time this algorithm is used in the NARMAX framework. The tests I've made are promising, but use it with caution until the results are formalized into a research paper.

## About AI Networks

Founded on August 5, 2019, AI Networks has quickly established itself as one of the most engaged and focused communities in the realm of artificial intelligence. Our community thrives on a shared passion for knowledge and a commitment to exploring the latest advancements in AI and machine learning.

Our community currently hosts four specialized groups:

- **AI/ML Brasil - Principal 01 & 02**: Our main groups dedicated to a wide range of AI and machine learning topics.
- **AI/ML Brasil - Prompt Engineering**: Focused on the art and science of designing effective prompts for AI systems.
- **AI/ML Brasil - Neurociência**: Exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience.

Join us to connect with like-minded individuals, engage in thought-provoking discussions, and stay at the forefront of AI innovation.
